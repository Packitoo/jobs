# We are Packitoo (Pack-It-Too)

At Packitoo, we made the first instant pricing engine or the packaging industry "HIPE" (https://hipe.packitoo.com/), this is real game changer in an industry where sales cycles can take weeks. We have big projects, tons of new features to make on a high quality react app, with a node backend and a python microservice for price prediction.
We are animated by the following values:

* PASSION: We like what we do, it drives us to make an awesome app
* RESPECT: We are all different, with our strength and weaknesses
* . We respect our customers, our colleagues, our planet and everyone on it.
* EXPLORATION: We are sailing in uncharted waters, connecting customers and manufacturers in their custom packaging project by making a software that changes the way they work like never before.
